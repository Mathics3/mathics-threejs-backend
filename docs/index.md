Welcome to the mathics-threejs-backend documentation and examples!

mathics-threejs-backend is a JavaScript library for rendering [Mathics](https://mathics.org) (and eventually Wolfram Language) [Graphics3D](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Graphics3D.html) objects.

This can be used in Mathics front ends like [Mathics-Django](https://pypi.org/project/Mathics-Django/) to handle 3D Graphics. The code may also be useful as a guide for other kinds of Mathics/WL frontends to other kinds of Javascript graphics engines.

See [our gallery](examples).
